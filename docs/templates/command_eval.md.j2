{% block Description %}
{{ super() }}
`eval` evaluates an expression and returns its results.

The expression is evaluated by the underlying Python interpreter. Unlike
standard evaluation, `eval` uses a set of custom functions and a custom
variables resolution mechanism.

Functions are [documented here](https://jpclipffel.github.io/m42pl-core/utils/eval/).
